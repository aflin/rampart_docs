# Rampart Documentation

Included here is the documentation for [Rampart JavaScript](https://github.com/aflin/rampart)
along with a webserver/search and typeahead/suggestion demo.  It also uses
``rampart-html`` to edit the html documents in order setup the search.

The documentation is built with
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and included in the 
``build/html/`` directory.

The ``web_server/`` directory includes a script to build the search
(on the first run) and start the web server.  Simply run:

``cd web_server``

and then:

``./start_docs_web_server.sh``


The documentation may also be found [here](https://rampart.dev/docs/).
