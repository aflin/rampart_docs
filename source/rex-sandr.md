# Rex and Sandr Reference for Rampart

## Overview

Rex is a high-performance pattern matching engine available in Rampart via `Sql.rex()`,
`Sql.rexFile()`, and `Sql.sandr()`. It is **not** Perl-compatible regex. It has its own
syntax optimized for speed — on x86 hardware it can be up to 3x faster than grep.

Rex is also available as a standalone command-line tool: `rex [options] expression [files]`.

```javascript
var Sql = require("rampart-sql");

// Search
var matches = Sql.rex(expression, data [, options] [, callback]);

// Search and Replace
var result = Sql.sandr(expression, replacement, data);
var result = Sql.sandr([[expr1, repl1], [expr2, repl2], ...], data);

// Search in file (memory-efficient for large files)
var matches = Sql.rexFile(expression, filename [, options] [, callback]);
```

## The Three Rules

These are the most important things to understand about rex. They differ from
grep/Perl regex and will cause confusion if not internalized.

### Rule 1: Repetition operators apply to the longest preceding expression (string-based)

Rex is **string-based**, not character-based. A repetition operator applies to the
entire preceding sub-expression, not just the last character.

```
abc=def*    means: one "abc" followed by zero or more "def"
                   NOT: "ab" then one "c" then "de" then zero or more "f"

hello+      means: one or more occurrences of "hello"
                   NOT: "hell" then one or more "o"
```

This is the opposite of grep/Perl where `abc*` means "ab then zero or more c".

### Rule 2: Every sub-expression needs a repetition operator

Every sub-expression must have exactly one of: `=`, `+`, `*`, or `{n,m}`.

```
=    exactly one occurrence (also captures as a submatch)
+    one or more occurrences
*    zero or more occurrences
?    zero or one occurrence (synonym for {0,1})
{x,y}  from x to y occurrences
{x}    exactly x occurrences
{x,}   x or more occurrences
{,y}   zero to y occurrences
```

An expression like `abc*def*` **cannot** be located because it matches every
position in the text (both parts can be zero occurrences).

### Rule 3: No matched sub-expression will be located as part of another

`a+ab` is idiosyncratic because `a+` is a subpart of `ab`.

## Sub-expressions and Submatches

The `=` operator is special: it means "exactly one occurrence" AND it captures
that occurrence as a **submatch**. Submatches are numbered starting at 1 in
replacement strings, or starting at 0 in the `submatches` array returned by rex.

```javascript
// Each = creates a submatch
// Pattern: >>=hello=.=!world*world=
// Submatches:  \1    \2  \3    \4

var r = Sql.rex('>>hello= =world=', 'hello world', {submatches:true});
// r[0].submatches == ["hello", " ", "world"]
//                      [0]    [1]    [2]     (0-based in array)
// In sandr replacement: \\1   \\2    \\3     (1-based)
```

Other repetition operators (`+`, `*`, `{n,m}`) also produce submatches. For `*`
or `{0,y}`, the submatch may be an empty string.

## Operators

### `>>` — Root Expression and Start-of-String Anchor

The `>>` operator serves two purposes:

1. **Root selection**: Forces rex to use the following sub-expression as the
   "root" — the starting point for the search. Rex normally picks the most
   efficient sub-expression automatically, but `>>` lets you override this.

2. **String anchoring**: `>>=` anchors to the start or end of the **string**
   (not line — rex is not bound by newlines; use `^` and `$` for line-based
   anchoring).
   - `>>=` at the **beginning** of the expression → anchor to start of string
   - `>>=` at the **end** of the expression → anchor to end of string

```
>>hello=!world*world=    root on "hello", match forward to "world"
>>=!search*search=       anchor at start of string, match up to "search"
.*there=>>=              anchor at end of string (match backwards from end)
x+>>y+z+                 find y first, then match x backward and z forward
```

### `!` — NOT Operator

Matches characters that are NOT the following fixed expression. The `!` operator
matches **one character at a time**, so repetition operators count characters.

```
!finish{2,4}    matches 2 to 4 characters (that aren't the start of "finish")
finish{2,4}     matches 2 to 4 times the string "finish"
```

**Cannot be used by itself** in an expression without `>>` or another anchor.
However, with `>>` it works fine as the root:

```
>>=!search*search=    anchor at start, match chars up to "search", then "search"
>>start=!end*end=     match "start", then any chars up to "end", then "end"
```

Note: `>>=.=!search*search=` also works (the `=.=` matches one any-char first)
but the `=.=` is not required — `>>=!search*search=` is sufficient.

### `\P` and `\F` — Preceded By / Followed By (Lookaround)

These are "zero-width" assertions. The matched sub-expression following `\P` or `\F`
is excluded from the match result.

```
\P=prefix=content+    match "content" only if preceded by "prefix"
content+\F=suffix=    match "content" only if followed by "suffix"
```

### `\R` and `\I` — Case Sensitivity

```
\R    begin respecting case (until end of sub-expression)
\I    begin ignoring case (default)
```

Case is always respected inside `[]` bracket sets.

### `\L` — Literal Mode

```
\L....\L    characters between \L pairs are taken literally (no special meanings)
```

### Character Classes

```
\alpha   \upper   \lower   \digit   \xdigit
\alnum   \space   \punct   \print   \graph
\cntrl   \ascii
```

### Special Characters

```
\n    newline       \t    tab          \v    vertical tab
\b    backspace     \r    carriage return
\f    form feed     \0    null character
\Xnn  hex character (e.g., \X0A for newline)
```

### Anchors

```
^     beginning of line
$     end of line
.     any single character
```

### Bracket Sets

```
[abc]       match any of a, b, c
[a-z]       range
[^abc]      NOT any of a, b, c (inverted set)
[\alpha--x] all alphabetic except x (set subtraction with --)
```

Case is always respected inside brackets.

## Escaping in JavaScript Strings

Since JavaScript interprets `\` before rex sees it, you must double-escape:

```javascript
// To get rex to see \{\{ (literal braces), write:
'\\{\\{'

// To get rex to see \digit, write:
'\\digit'

// To get rex to see \n (newline), write:
'\\n'

// To get rex to see \P (preceded by), write:
'\\P'
```

**Characters that need escaping in rex:** `\ = ? + * { } , [ ] ^ $ . - ! >`

The string `>>` is special. To match a literal `>>`, write `\\>>`.

## Sql.rex() — Search

```javascript
var Sql = require("rampart-sql");
var ret = Sql.rex(expr, data [, options] [, callback]);
```

**Parameters:**

- `expr` — String or Array of Strings (rex expressions)
- `data` — String, Buffer, or Array of Strings/Buffers
- `options` — Object:
  - `exclude`: `"none"` | `"overlap"` | `"duplicate"` (default)
  - `submatches`: `true` | `false` (default false without callback, true with)
- `callback` — `function(match, submatchInfo, index)` (when submatches:true)
  or `function(match, index)` (when submatches:false)

**Return value:**

- Without callback, no submatches: Array of matching strings
- Without callback, with submatches: Array of objects:
  ```javascript
  [{match: "...", expressionIndex: 0, submatches: ["...", "..."]}, ...]
  ```
- With callback: Number (count of matches)

**Callback return:** Return `false` from callback to stop matching early.

**Exclude modes** (for multiple expressions that might overlap):

- `"none"` — return all matches, even overlapping
- `"overlap"` — remove shorter match when two overlap
- `"duplicate"` — (default) remove shorter when one encompasses another

## Sql.sandr() — Search and Replace

```javascript
var result = Sql.sandr(expr, replace, data);
var result = Sql.sandr([[expr1, repl1], [expr2, repl2], ...], data);
```

**Parameters:**

- `expr` — String or Array of Strings (search expressions)
- `replace` — String or Array of Strings (replacements; padded with "" if fewer)
- `data` — String or Array of Strings

**Replacement string syntax:**

- `?` — ditto: copy the character at this position from the matched text
- `{5}` — the 5th character of the matched text
- `\1`, `\2`, ... — the Nth submatch (1-based numbering)
- `\&` — the entire match (excluding `\P`/`\F` portions)
- `+` — incrementing decimal number (for numbering)
- `#N` — Nth submatch in hexadecimal
- `\xHH` — literal hex character
- `\\` — literal backslash
- `\?`, `\#`, `\{`, `\}`, `\+` — literal special characters

**Array form** processes pairs in order, each pair applied to the result of the previous:

```javascript
var result = Sql.sandr([
    ["search1", "replace1"],
    ["search2", "replace2"]
], data);
```

## Sql.rexFile() — Search in File

Same as `Sql.rex()` but takes a filename instead of data string. Memory-efficient
for large files.

```javascript
var ret = Sql.rexFile(expr, filename [, options] [, callback]);
```

Additional option:
- `delimiter` — expression for end of read buffer. Default is `$` (end of line).
  Set this if your pattern crosses lines, to ensure matches aren't split at
  buffer boundaries.

## Sql.sandr2() / Sql.re2() / Sql.re2File()

These are identical to their rex counterparts but use **Perl-compatible regular
expressions** (RE2 syntax) instead of rex syntax. Useful when you need Perl regex
features, but generally slower than rex.

## Practical Patterns for Wikitext Processing

### Finding patterns (rex)

```javascript
// All {{...}} template blocks (non-nested)
Sql.rex('>>\\{\\{=!\\}\\}*\\}\\}=', text)

// All [[...]] internal links
Sql.rex('>>\\[\\[=!\\]\\]*\\]\\]=', text)

// Bold '''...''' markup
Sql.rex(">>'''=!'''*'''=", text)

// Italic ''...'' markup
Sql.rex(">>''=!''*''=", text)

// HTML comments <!-- ... -->
Sql.rex('>><!--=!-->*-->=', text)

// Everything from start of string up to first occurrence of "search"
Sql.rex('>>=!search*search=', text)
```

### Search and replace (sandr)

```javascript
// Strip bold: '''text''' -> text
Sql.sandr(">>'''=!'''*'''=", "\\2", text)

// Strip italic: ''text'' -> text
Sql.sandr(">>''=!''*''=", "\\2", text)

// Piped links: [[target|label]] -> label
Sql.sandr(">>\\[\\[=[^|\\]]+|=[^\\]]+\\]\\]=", "\\4", text)
// Submatches: \1=[[  \2=target  \3=|  \4=label  \5=]]

// Simple links: [[target]] -> target
Sql.sandr(">>\\[\\[=!\\]\\]*\\]\\]=", "\\2", text)

// Strip HTML comments
Sql.sandr(">><!--=!-->*-->=", "", text)

// Strip <ref>...</ref>
Sql.sandr(">><=ref=!</ref*</ref>=", "", text)

// Strip self-closing <ref ... />
Sql.sandr(">><=ref =!\\/>*\\/>=", "", text)

// HTML entity decoding
Sql.sandr([
    ["&amp;=", "&"],
    ["&lt;=", "<"],
    ["&gt;=", ">"],
    ["&quot;=", "\""],
    ["&nbsp;=", " "]
], text)

// Full cleanup pipeline (applied in order)
Sql.sandr([
    [">><!--=!-->*-->=", ""],                              // comments
    [">><=ref=!</ref*</ref>=", ""],                        // <ref>...</ref>
    [">><=ref =!\\/>*\\/>=", ""],                          // <ref ... />
    [">>'''=!'''*'''=", "\\2"],                            // bold
    [">>''=!''*''=", "\\2"],                               // italic
    [">>\\[\\[=[^|\\]]+|=[^\\]]+\\]\\]=", "\\4"],         // piped links
    [">>\\[\\[=!\\]\\]*\\]\\]=", "\\2"],                   // simple links
    ["&amp;=", "&"],                                        // entities
    ["&lt;=", "<"],
    ["&gt;=", ">"],
    ["&quot;=", "\""],
    ["&nbsp;=", " "]
], text)
```

### Submatches with callback

```javascript
// Extract template names from wikitext
Sql.rex('>>\\{\\{=!\\}\\}*\\}\\}=', text, {submatches:true},
    function(match, info, index) {
        var inner = info.submatches[1]; // content between {{ and }}
        var pipePos = inner.indexOf('|');
        var name = pipePos >= 0 ? inner.substring(0, pipePos) : inner;
        printf("Template: %s\n", name);
    }
);
```

### rexFile with delimiter for cross-line matching

```javascript
// Match <doc>...</doc> blocks spanning multiple lines
Sql.rexFile(
    '>><doc id\\="=\\digit+!title*title\\="\\P=[^"]+[^>]+>=!</doc+',
    filename,
    {delimiter: '</doc>'},
    function(match, info, i) {
        // process each doc block
    }
);
```

## Key Differences from Perl Regex

| Feature | Perl Regex | Rex |
|---|---|---|
| Repetition applies to | last character | longest preceding expression |
| `ab*` means | "a" then 0+ "b" | 0+ "ab" |
| Character match | `.` | `.=` (need repetition) |
| Submatch capture | `(group)` | `=` operator on sub-expression |
| Backreference | `\1` in pattern | `\1` only in replacement |
| Alternation | `a|b` | use Array of expressions |
| Lookahead | `(?=...)` | `\F=...` |
| Lookbehind | `(?<=...)` | `\P=...` |
| NOT | `[^...]` for chars | `!expr` for strings |
| Case insensitive | `/i` flag | `\I` (default) / `\R` |
| Literal mode | `\Q...\E` | `\L...\L` |

## Performance Notes

- Rex uses "state-anticipation" (Boyer-Moore-like) matching: longer patterns are
  faster to find, not slower
- The `>>` operator helps performance by telling rex which sub-expression to search
  for first
- Rex automatically picks the most efficient fixed-length sub-expression as the
  search root, and matches other parts forward and backward from there
- `Sql.rexFile()` is preferred over `Sql.rex()` for large files — it streams
  rather than loading the entire file into memory
- `Sql.sandr()` with the array-of-pairs form applies all replacements in a single
  pass through the data, which is more efficient than calling sandr repeatedly

## Limitations

- Cannot handle **nested** delimiters. `>>\\{\\{=!\\}\\}*\\}\\}=` on
  `{{outer|{{inner}}}}` will match `{{outer|{{inner}}` (stops at first `}}`).
  Nested brace matching requires a stack-based algorithm outside of rex.
- No alternation within a single expression — use an Array of expressions instead
- No backreferences within the search pattern (only in replacement strings)
- The `!` NOT operator cannot be used by itself, but works as root with `>>`
